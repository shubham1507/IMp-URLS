### **What are AI Agents?**
AI agents are systems that perceive their environment, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can be simple (e.g., a chatbot) or complex (e.g., autonomous robots). AI agents are typically powered by machine learning, deep learning, or rule-based systems.
